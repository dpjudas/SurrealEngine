Surreal Engine Known Bugs and Woes
----------------------------------

Engine general:
---------------
* Movers aren't fully implemented. They don't have any collision, and only "work" if there is a trigger that activates them.
* Scripted textures are not implemented.
* Some native functions related to text rendering aren't implemented, resulting in glitchy texts.
* Mirrors/reflections rendering isn't implemented.
* Portals aren't implemented. They do not render or "teleport" the player, and crash the engine under certain conditions.
* Some rendering glitches may occur when transparent surfaces are involved. An earlier attempt at fixing it wasn't entirely successful.
* Bot and Scripted Pawn AI isn't fully functional due to the related native functions not being implemented.
All they currently do is to sometimes retaliate if attacked, and pick up nearby items.
* Bots literally rotate their entire body (feet off the ground) to look up/down in ways they shouldn't be able to.
* Decals don't clip to BSP correctly, or sometimes do not appear at all.
* Waving water textures at the end of waterfalls render broken. Easily observable in NyLeve's Falls (Unreal) or DM-ArcaneTemple (UT)
* Inventory travelling is quite buggy: Either they travel, but get deselected upon the next level load, or cause a crash.
And not all travel types are implemented.
* Player-to-decoration and player-to-other-pawns collisions aren't properly implemented. The player usually gets stuck and if they manage to get free
they end up dying because SE thinks that they've fallen from a great height.
* If the player currently has a power-up active that tints the screen (like Invisibility or Energy Amplifier), the tint remains
(and accumulates if a new power-up of the same type is picked up and activated) until the player switches to a different map.
* viewclass command crashes with null deref.
* Sometimes opening a map crashes the engine with a "Failed to spawn the player actor" error.
* Third person views don't work properly as the player character is not rendered.
* Teleporters do not work properly sometimes.
* Zones don't apply velocity to the players when they should (Like the conveyor belt in DM-Conveyor)
* Zones don't hurt the player when they should (Drowning in water/getting burned in lava, etc.)
* Games don't pause when ESC is pressed.
* There are no OpenGL and D3D renderers.
* There is no networking support at all.
* By design, native mods will never work with SE. Thankfully these kind of mods are extremely rare.
* [Linux/ZWidget] Wayland backend is somewhat buggy due to Wayland APIs being unpleasant to work with, to name a few things:
 - Menus don't properly position themselves.
 - Sometimes menus remain persistent (due to rapidly switching?)
 - Running any ZWidget app (launcher/SurrealEditor) on GNOME will probably lead to not being able to move the window around, 
 because ZWidget has no custom window decorations (ZWidget uses server side decorations when they're available)

Engine general - Needs testing:
-------------------------------
* There seem to be a memory leak due to Garbage Collection not being implemented. This is probably extremely hard to notice as UE1 games 
won't use much memory when run on modern computers. Might need to run SE for a looooong time before it is noticeable.
* Gibbing on certain maps in Debug mode causes out of bounds vertex access
* Lightmap rendering is kind of off

Unreal (Gold) specific:
-----------------------
* [227*] Many new native functions/features are not yet implemented.
* ALL RTNP models are broken (at least in 226?).
* Fighting Skaarj can sometimes lead to crashes.
* Firing sounds don't seem to play with Eightball Gun and RazorJack.
* Zones are extremely broken, especially water zones. Easily observable with DmAriza.
* Nali Fruit Seeds and ASMDs in a map don't render, but are pickable.
* ASMD primary fire rings does not render.
* Player model does not render in the Player Setup menu.

Unreal Tournament specific:
---------------------------
* [469*] Many new native functions/features are not yet implemented.
* In certain situations (compiler related?) the engine can crash after running for a second.
* Shock Rifle beams render glitchy.
* Player model is rendered upside-down in the Player Setup menu.
* UDamage effect does not render.
* Player can slide through on some of the catwalks in the room with lava in DM-Conveyor

Deus Ex specific:
-----------------
* Keyboard (and mouse?) input doesn't work. No keys are recognized, preventing us from testing literally everything else.
Might be because input stuff is moved to native Extension package, which isn't implemented?

Tactical-Ops: Assault on Terror specific:
-----------------------------------------
* Main menu has a red tint for some reason.
* Attempting to bring up the menus crashes the engine.
* Opening up any map crashes the engine.

Any other UE1 game not mentioned above:
--------------------------------------
* They crash the engine upon startup for various reasons. Will probably take quite a while before the necessary functionality gets implemented.
